# Use-a-Pre-trained-image-classifier-for-identifying-dog-breeds

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project was to improve our Python programming abilities while developing an image classifier that could recognize various dog breeds. Modern deep learning model known as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used by the classifier. This CNN was trained beforehand on a sizable dataset of 1.2 million photos from ImageNet, allowing it to pick up on traits that are important for identifying dogs.

## Key Features
constructed a powerful dog breed classifier using a pretrained CNN model. Utilize transfer learning to take advantage of the features discovered in the ImageNet dataset. demonstrated mastery of the Python programming language. a better understanding of how to use frameworks for deep learning for picture categorization jobs.

## Project Details
In order to improve our proficiency in Python programming, we gave Python a lot of attention in this project. The main focus of the project was improving our Python programming skills, even if the creation of an image classifier was at its core.

## Classifier Architecture
The convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used by the picture classifier. As a result of its capacity to automatically identify pertinent elements from input, this kind of neural network is especially well suited for tasks involving images. The ImageNet dataset, which contains a wide variety of objects, including different dog breeds, was used to train the CNN that was used in this study.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we improved our Python programming skills while also producing a useful dog breed image classifier. With the aid of a pretrained CNN model and a well curated dataset, we were able to learn a lot about deep learning methods for picture categorization. This project demonstrates our commitment to learning Python and using it for practical machine learning problems.
